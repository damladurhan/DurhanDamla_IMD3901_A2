In this assignment, I created a VR world using A-frame with HTML and JavaScript. The concept of the application is Egypt. 
Therefore, I added the "Egypt" environment to the VR. There are two buttons. The left button creates ancient Egyptian sculptures. 
The user can drag the sculptures around and delete them by clicking on them if they like to. The right button creates a sunrise/sunset animation. 
The light loop through the sky until the user presses the button again. Then the sun stops animating, and the user can drag the sun around 
to position them into the place they like. Furthermore, with the sun animation, Eygptian ambient music comes to play. The application is 
also compatible with mobile. The user can press the button, drag the sun around and hear the ambient music with their headphones (or earphones).
However, the 3D sculpture model is way too big for the mobile. Therefore, it takes time to load the sculpture and sometimes causes the website 
to crash. I chose this design because I wanted to give the users the feeling that they are living in Ancient Egypt, building sculptures around 
the pyramids. I put the sun animation to provide the VR with a natural aesthetic. 

It was very challenging to figure out how to instantiate and remove functions. Moreover, it was not easy to implement all the required 
functionalities under one concept. I wanted all the functionalities to make sense with the idea of my virtual world. I looked through 
some ideas to inspire me to use in my application. In the end, I figured out an application that makes sense with my concept.
